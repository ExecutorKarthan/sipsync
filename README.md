# SipSync

## Description
We have created an application that is used to help users find food and drink pairings. The user can make their selection of either a food or a drink, and the application would then give the user the best possible combinations to have with the user's selection. So for instance, if the user were to select their favorite kind of food to have for dinner, then the application would give a list of meals to have that fit that food type, and also a drink that would go well with it. The main intention of this application is to help someone find a way to better enjoy their favorite food or drink. 

## How to Use the Application
The use of this application is very simple. The user is presented with three sections: alcohol type, drink type, and food type. The user can select either a drink or a food. Once search is clicked, then the user is presented with a list of drink options and a list of food options. They can click through each one to see them all. If the user finds a drink and food pairing that they like, they can click the save button, and it will save that food and drink to the saved combos page.
