# SipSync

## Description
We have created an application that is used to help users find food and drink pairings. The user can make their selection of either a food or a drink, and the application would then give the user
the best combination to have with the user's selection. So for instance, if the user were to select their favorite dish to have for dinner, then application would then also show what drink would
be best paired to have with that selected dish. The main intention of this application is to help someone find a way to better enjoy their favorite food or drink.
